## Long-Term Strategy to Boost Direct-to-Consumer Revenue 

1. Build a content-based recommendation engine using existing wine data.
2. Introduce data collection methods to gather real user preferences (Implic vs Explicit feedback)
    User registration, forms, etc (tracking user preferences over time).
3. Evolve to collaborative filtering as the dataset grows and matures.


Key Selling Points 
- immediate Engagement & Personalization with content-based recommendations, which immediately enhances the consumer experience.
- Revenue Growth Potential: 
- Personalized recommendations increase conversion rates, AOV, and ultimately the companyâ€™s revenue.
- Scalability: As more user data is collected, the recommendation system will only improve, ensuring long-term value.
Data-Driven Insights: The system also allows the company to gather data on consumer behavior, which can be used for future marketing and product development decisions.

## Business Impact

A. Immediate Value:
- Personalized Experience: Even without user data, the content-based recommendation engine provides relevant, personalized suggestions based on wine characteristics. This enhances customer experience immediately.

    - Metric: CTR for recommended wines, engagement on the platform.

B. Short-Term Value:
- Increased Sales: With more personalized suggestions, the system improves conversion rates and average order value as users are more likely to discover wines they love or add more bottles to their cart.

    - Metric: Purchase conversion rate, AOV.

C. Long-Term Value:
- Customer Retention and Loyalty: Over time, as more user data is collected, the system will drive repeat purchases by providing even more personalized suggestions. This fosters customer loyalty and increases the lifetime value of each customer.

    - Metric: Repeat purchase rate, user lifetime value (LTV).
