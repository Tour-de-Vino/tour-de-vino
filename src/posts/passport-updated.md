![The **Sogrape Passport** is an exciting adventure for wine enthusiasts, offering a unique opportunity to explore Sogrape’s vast array of physical locations, including vineyards, cellars, and tasting rooms.](tour-de-vino/static/Passport.png)

The Passport acts as a companion for those who embark on this journey, incentivizing them to visit different Sogrape sites across various regions and countries. The goal is to engage customers with a long-term challenge that not only deepens their connection with the brand but also rewards them for exploring all that Sogrape has to offer.

1. **Starting the Journey**:

   Customers enter the program by filling out simple forms detailing their interests and preferences. This allows Sogrape to create a **Passport**, which contains a curated list of physical experiences such as vineyard tours, cellar visits, wine tastings, and more.

2. **Engagement and Challenges**:
   The Passport is designed as a **long-term challenge** that encourages customers to visit multiple locations and participate in Sogrape activities. For every completed experience—whether it’s a tour of a vineyard or a wine-tasting event—customers receive a physical label or pin to place in their Passport.

3. **The Ultimate Reward**:
   Customers are driven by the goal of completing their Passport by visiting every location and participating in every recommended activity. Once all the locations and experiences have been completed, customers receive an exclusive reward, such as limited-edition wine or an unforgettable experience tailored by Sogrape.

4. **A Game for Wine Enthusiasts**:
   The Passport is designed to be an immersive game that keeps customers engaged over time. As they progress through the various regions and countries, they not only enjoy the richness of Sogrape’s offerings but also feel a sense of achievement as they collect more pins and move closer to completing their Passport.

## Key Benefits:

- **Increased Customer Engagement**: The Passport motivates ongoing participation, driving repeat visits to Sogrape’s locations and fostering deeper brand connections.
- **Tourism and Brand Exposure**: By promoting visits to physical sites, the Passport enhances Sogrape’s in-person tourism experiences, leading to higher sales and stronger brand loyalty.
- **Reward-Based Gamification**: Customers are incentivized to complete their Passport, which keeps them engaged and motivated to continue their journey with Sogrape.
