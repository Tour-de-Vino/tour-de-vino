## Build a content-based recommendation engine using existing wine data

1. Recommedation of **similar wines based on similar features** (i.e. grape variety, producer, etc.)
2. Suggest wines based on their previous preferences and interactions or ratings.

### Basic Approach

![Principal Component Analysis](PCA.png)

> We can analyse the _intrinsic characteristics_ of the wines and cluster them into groups based on their similarities. This will allow us to recommend wines that are similar to the ones the user has liked in the past. This following plot healights the first three principal components of the wines, which can be used to cluster them into groups.
> Each component is a linear combination of multiple chacharecteristics of the wines, such as _acidity_, _sweetness_, etc.

### Upgrade Path

- Evolve to **collaborative filtering** as the dataset grows and matures.

Information about user preferences can be used to recommend wines that similar users have liked in the past.

This leads to:

# Immediate Engagement & Personalization

- Personalized Experience: Even without user data, the content-based recommendation engine provides relevant, personalized suggestions based on wine characteristics. This enhances customer experience immediately.

  - Metric: CTR for recommended wines, engagement on the platform.

# Revenue Growth Potential

# Increasing Conversion Rates

- Increased Sales: With more personalized suggestions, the system improves conversion rates and average order value as users are more likely to discover wines they love or add more bottles to their cart.

  - Metric: Purchase conversion rate, AOV.

# Scalability

# Customer Retention

Long-Term Value:

- Customer Retention and Loyalty: Over time, as more user data is collected, the system will drive repeat purchases by providing even more personalized suggestions. This fosters customer loyalty and increases the lifetime value of each customer.

  - Metric: Repeat purchase rate, user lifetime value (LTV).
