### Upgrade Path

<!-- Transitioning to **collaborative filtering** as the data grows and matures will enable more personalized and accurate recomendations.

- Customer Feedback Data Collection Pipelines:
1. **Explicit Feedback**: Gather direct customer inputs through ratings, reviews, and comments. Implement post-purchase surveys or incentivized feedback systems that encourage user participation without being overly intrusive.
2. **Implicit Feedback**: Implement passive data collection through non-intrusive methods such as tracking user interactions with product pages, time spent per page, browsing behavior, cart additions, and purchase frequency.-->

### Key Advantages

- Scalable solution.
- Real time suggestions
- Fully automated
- AI-driven and human expertise independent.

Information about user preferences can be used to recommend wines that similar users have liked in the past.
