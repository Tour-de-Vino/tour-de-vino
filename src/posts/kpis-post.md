# Simulating User Interaction & Recommender KPIs

---

Breakdown of the Process:
Recommendation Flow:

1. Recommendation Flow:
   Click-Through Rate (CTR):
   Returning users have a 50% chance of clicking on a recommended wine.
   Once clicked, they have a 70% chance of viewing details and a 30% chance of adding to cart.
   These probabilities are higher because the system shows wines aligned with the userâ€™s preference, making it more likely that they will engage with the wine.

2. Random Flow:
   Click-Through Rate (CTR):
   Returning users have only a 5% chance of clicking on a randomly presented wine.
   If they do click, they have a 40% chance of viewing details and only a 10% chance of adding to cart.
   These lower probabilities reflect that random wines are less likely to match the user's tastes, reducing the chance of engagement.

### Business Impact

- recommended system yields significantly better metrics than showing random wines

By simulating both recommended and random interactions with these probabilities, recommended system yields significantly better metrics than showing random wines, such as:

- Higher CTR: More users click on wines that are recommended (50% vs. 5%).
- Higher Conversion Rate: More users ultimately add to cart and purchase recommended wines (30% after viewing details vs. 10% for random).
- Higher Average Order Value (AOV): Because the recommendation system suggests relevant wines (often in higher price ranges for premium buyers), users are more likely to buy higher-value wines.
- Repeat Purchase Rate: Users who find wines they like via recommendations are more likely to return and buy again.

# Future Work for Data Collection

## During Wine Tasting and Vineyard Visit

1. **Object detection**:

   - Wine Glasses Sensors.
      -  Track how long customers engage with each wine.
      -  Analyze drinking patterns, such as tasting frequency and pauses between sips.

2. **Interactive Wine Tasting App**:

   - User-friendly app to rate wines in real-time. 
      - Ask for feedback on taste notes, such as sweetness, tannins, or acidity.
      - Gather data to identify trends and preferences, providing insights into regional or demographic taste profiles.
      - Allow customers to scan points of interest with their smartphones.
      - Provide educational content, videos, or fun facts about different vineyard locations.   


3. **Wearable Technology**:

   - Equip customers with wearables like rings or wristbands that monitor physiological responses.
      - Capture emotional responses to wines, revealing which wines elicit excitement, relaxation, or other emotions.
      - Refine wine recommendations based on customers' emotional engagement.
      - Identify which vineyard sections attract the most interest and engagement.
      - Improve the layout of future tours and optimize customer flow.

4. **Loyalty Program**
   - Ideal to gather user historical data and preferences.
